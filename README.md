This application features:
  - A login form with 13 pairs of usernames and passwords (1 Owner, 1 Admin, 1 Logisitics Coordinator & 10 Couriers).
  - Levels of access where certain parts of the program will be limited to some users.
  - A dashboard where the user can access a multitude of other forms depending on their level of access.
  - Ability to view, edit & create new entries in database tables.
  - A system to take an hour long break between 11am - 1pm.
  - Setting time and dates of delivery assignments.
  
HOW TO USE:

- Also before starting, make sure the service references have been properly updated as you will not be able to login otherwise.
